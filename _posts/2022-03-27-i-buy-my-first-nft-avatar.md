# Story
Because Boring.

Because in China, cryptocurrency is totally illegal. Even I am in Singapore right now, buy ETH from some *Centralized Exchanges* is totally impossible. Another way to buy ETH is *Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)*. It needs a lot of money to do this p2p exchange and I can not afford it. Luckily, I find a way to exchange BTC to ETH considering I have some BTC in hand (from *Zhu Yicheng*), using [changelly](https://changelly.com/).

Very interesting story, I find a NFT avatar have Hawaiian shirt and knitted hat which are two thing can represent me in the period of Singapore. So I think is it a real serendipity to meet it. So i decided to buy it. It is like:

## NFT: Giraffe #6759 from collection [Pixel Giraffes](https://opensea.io/collection/pixel-giraffes)

## At last

Finally, in my opinion, I think NFT is a great way to create art and sell art. But the most NFT avatar is just a new stupid '换装小游戏' or new 'QQ秀' that you can choose some elements provided by others to change your web avatar. It is not web3, just a new way to take your money out like 10 years ago.
